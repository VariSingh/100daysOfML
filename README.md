### Day 0: July 6, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Watched youtube video by Josh Gordon on how to build decision tree classifier from scratch.

**Summary:** In decision tree classifier you basically take all data with labels and put it in root node and ask question on it. Then based on true or false answer you split the data into two chunks which become next nodes of the tree. This goes on untill there is no further questions left to ask.
Note: This is perhaps the worst way to descript it. lol. I'll keep improving.

### Day 1: July 7, 2018

**Today's Progress:** Studied the algorithm in detail and started writing the program in javascript

**Summary:** I have written function to find unique values from a column in dataset. Format of my data is different than that mentioned in tutorial so I will have to improvise for the new format. I am studying from here: https://github.com/random-forests/tutorials/blob/master/decision_tree.ipynb
